# nodelabs

This repo contains a set of labs for use with node on SmartOS (and some of these, soon, 
on linux running on an lx branded zone on SmartOS).  Each lab is in a separate directory.
These labs are not meant to teach node.  Instead they show the use of some tools and methodologies
that Joyent uses with Node.js.  

More, better labs will be added.
